WIP notes about `bundix`
========================

There is nothing fundamentally broken with the current bundix. Though there are
differences in expectations that means things will not work as expected out of
the box.

Starting from the state at c841f86b4e83c0c29b53b3a0e3c5bc0234763555, we can
observe in `Gemfile.lock`:

```
PLATFORMS
  arm64-darwin-20
```

This is the root cause of all issues. No, not arm64, neither is darwin, nor 20.

The issue is the lock is made assuming the project can and should use pre-built
binaries.

(Assuming presence of the pinned Nixpkgs)

We can fix the problem this way:

```
 $ nix-shell -I nixpkgs=./nixpkgs.nix -p bundix bundler ruby
[nix-shell:~/.../rails-nix]$ bundler lock --add-platform ruby
[nix-shell:~/.../rails-nix]$ ruby -e 'require "bundler"; Bundler::LockfileParser.new(Bundler.read_file(Bundler.default_lockfile)).platforms.map(&:to_s).each { |plat| unless plat == "ruby" then system("bundler", "lock", "--remove-platform=#{plat}") end }'
```

The idea here is to add the `ruby` platform (generic), and remove any
platform-specific platforms that bring in pre-built binaries.

The second command is a mouthful, and should be integrated *somehow* into the
relevant tooling.

Running `bundix -l` again should produce results that work now. A way to check
with the current setup is to look at the nokogiri definition in the gemset:

```
@@ -428,7 +480,7 @@
     version = "2.5.8";
   };
   nokogiri = {
-    dependencies = ["racc"];
+    dependencies = ["mini_portile2" "racc"];
     groups = ["default" "development"];
     platforms = [];
     source = {
```

If it brings in `mini_portile2`, it's defined correctly.

Using `nix-shell` will now appropriately **do a local build**.

This adds a bit more build time, but it's a small trade-off for more "purity"
and coherence in the build.

```
